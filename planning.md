# Simon Says Project 1

# Title: Simon Says

# Objective: The objective of the game is to repeat the sequences of colors as accurately as possibly to advance to higher levels.

# Gameplay:
1. Start: The game begins with a welcome screen and a "Start" button.

2. Level 1: Upon clicking 'Start', Level 1 begins. The game will show a single color (e.g., green).

3. Simon's Turn: Simon, the virtual game leader, says, "Simon says, 'Green!'" and the green color is highlighted. The player must click or tap the green area in response to this command.

4. Player's Turn: The player must click the green area. If the player clicks the correct color, they move on to the next level. If they click the wrong color, a "Game Over" message appears, and the game ends.

5. Level Up: If the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game proceeds to Level 2. In Level 2, Simon adds another color to the sequence. For example, Simon may say, "Simon says, 'Green, Red!'" The player must now click both the green and red areas in the correct order.

6. Increasing Complexity: The game continues to increase in complexity by adding more colors and longer sequences at each level. The player needs to mimic Simon's commands accurately to progress.

7. Game Over: If the player makes a mistake in copying Simon's sequence, they receive a "Game Over" message and their final score is displayed.

8. Scoring: The player's score will be based on the number of correct sequences they repeat. The higher the level reached, the higher the score. Each sequence is multiplied by 5 and a total is displayed to give current score.

9. Play Again: After a game over, the player can choose to play again and attempt to beat their previous score.
