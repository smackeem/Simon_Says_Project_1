## Pseudocode
1. Define required constants:
   1.1 Define an array of colors representing the possible game colors.

2. Define required variables:
   2.1 Create a pattern array to store the sequence of colors generated by Simon.
   2.2 Create a userPattern array to store the user's input.
   2.3 Initialize a level variable to track the current game level.
   2.4 Initialize a highScore variable to track the user's current score after each level. 
   2.5 Create a turn variable to track whose turn it is (Simon or the user).

3. Store page elements in variables:
   3.1 Store elements like color buttons, a start button, and display messages.

4. Initialize the game:
   4.1 Initialize state variables: 
      4.1.1 Initialize the pattern array, userPattern array, level, highScore and turn.
   4.2 Set up event listeners for buttons. 
   4.3 Display a welcome message and provide instructions to start the game.

5. Start the game when the user clicks "Start":
   5.1 If the game is not already in progress, generate the first color pattern (e.g., add a random color to the pattern array). 
   5.2 Begin Simon's turn:
      5.2.1 Display the current level. 
      5.2.2 Show the color pattern to the user. 
      5.2.3 Allow Simon to complete its turn before accepting user input. 
      5.2.4 Display the user's current highScore. 

6. Handle user input (color button clicks):
   6.1 When the user clicks a color button:
      6.1.1 Add the color to the userPattern array.
      6.1.2 Check if the userPattern matches the pattern up to the current level.
      6.1.3 If the userPattern matches, allow the user to proceed to the next level.
      6.1.4 If the userPattern doesn't match, display a Game Over message.
      6.1.5 If Game Over, allow user to restart the game.
      6.1.6 Update and Display highScore.

7. Handle replay button click:
   8.1 Reset the game by initializing state variables (as in step 4.1).
   8.2 Restart the game from the beginning.

8. Implement a win condition:
   9.1 When the user reaches a predefined maximum level (e.g., 15), display a victory message.
   9.2 Allow the user to replay the game.

9. Implement a lose condition:
    10.1 If the user makes an incorrect input, display a game over message.
    10.2 Allow the user to replay the game.

10. Implement game logic for generating Simon's pattern, checking user input, and advancing levels.

11. Update the game interface to reflect the current state, including level, highScore, user feedback, and colors.

12. Handle user input and game progression according to the rules of Simon Says.

13. Continuously loop through the game logic until a win or lose condition is met.
